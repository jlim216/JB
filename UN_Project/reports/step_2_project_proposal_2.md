# Project Proposal 2

**Overview**

  - The project intends to examine the **“United Nations General
    Assembly Voting Data”** posted on the *Harvard Dataverse.* The
    dataset examines all the “roll-call votes in the UN General
    Assembly” from 1946 to 2018. A glimpse of the dataset can be found
    below (1,199,022 observations and 34 variables).

  - The code book of the dataset articulates the variables of the raw
    UNGA dataset. Notable variables include Vote Choice (with 1 as Yes,
    2 as Abstain, 3 as No, 8 as Absent, 9 as Not a member), Country
    Code, Year of Vote, Votes identified as important by U.S. State
    Department report and Issue Codes.
    
      - Issue Codes include: Votes relating to the Palestinian Conflict,
        Nuclear weapons and nuclear material, Arms control and
        disarmanent, Colonialism, Human Rights, Economic Development.

  - Alongside the UNGA dataset, I will include the additional datasets
    from “Freedom in the World” and “Center for Systemic Peace” which
    present data on 1) Major Cases of Political Violence, 2) High
    Casualty Terrorist Bombings, 3) Countries and their Freedom Ratings
    (Free, Partially Free, Not Free), 4) Scores for Freedom of
    Expression, Rule of Law, Individual Rights, Civil Liberty, Electoral
    Process.

  - I hope to study the voting patterns of individual nations for each
    issue group and produce a meaningful analysis of the future of
    America’s hegemonic global leadership (given the rise of China,
    weakening liberal international order, increase in terrorism).
    Sub-quesitons may include the following:
    
      - Whether the voting behaviors of “electoral democracies” and
        nations with high levels of “freedom of expression” align with
        one another.
      - The impact of “violence” and “terrorism” occurence to a nation’s
        voting behavior.
      - How other nations are responding to the rise of China.

**Challenge for Team**

  - The Challenge would be for the team to analyze the impact of
    “identity” in the formation of the world order. In particular, the
    team will examine whether nations with similar freedom levels are
    likely to have coinciding voting patterns.

**Decomposition of Project**

  - Progress report 1 (Week 4): Working Progress of 1) Aligning voting
    data of different nations, 2) Examining the relationship between
    nations’ freedom levels and voting behavior, 3) Studying how the
    relationship between violence and voting behavior, 4) Understanding
    Ideal Point Estimation, 5) Working thesis on the “research
    question.”

  - Progress report 2 (Week 6): TBD.

  - Challenge for rest of the team (Week 7): TBD.

  - Final Report (Week 9): TBD.
